# shell-scripting-with-node
Supplement materials for my Lightning Talk on writing shell scripts with Node

If you would like to try implementing these scripts on your own, you can navigate through the branches of this repo to reveal only certain scripts at a time. 

## get started
    git clone https://github.com/cjea/shell-scripting-with-node.git
    cd shell-scripting-with-node
    chmod 700 {get,greet,log-args,write-file}.js



Happy hacking!
